Week 2 Introducing Google Cloud

Learning objectives
	1. Identify the benefits of Google Cloud.
	2. Define the components of the Google network infrastructure, including points of presence, data centers, regions, and zones.
	3. Identify the difference between infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).

Cloud Computing Overview
	- way of using IT that has 5 equal important traits
		1. On demand and self service
		2. Access those resources from anywhere over the internet
		3. Provider allocates resources to users out of the pool
		4. Resources are elastic means flexible
		5. Pay what you use/reserver as they go

Why in demand nowadays?
	History
		First wave
			colocation
				- users rents physical space of the DC provider without investing own data center
		
		Second wave
			virtualized data center
				- uses virtual devices, match physical building blocks(CPUs, Disks, network) of hosted computing resources
				- enterprieses still maintain infra and user controleed/user-config env
				- not fast enough cuz not automated

		Third wave
			Container-based architecture
				- fully automated elastic(auto scale) means automated service and scalable data
				- auto provision and config infra used to run app

		Future wave
			Data Company
				- great software based on high quality data

	- policies defined in
		org node
		folder
		project
Four level hierarchy
	1. resources
		VM in GCE
		buckets in GCS
		tables in bigquery

	2. Projects
		org in folders or subfolders
		policy here can enbale and use 
			services, 
			api, 
			billing, 
			add/remove collaborator
		can have diff owners and users
			billed and managed serpately

		attributes
			project id
				globally unique and can't be changed
				immutable
					used by google of exact project to work with
			proj name
				user created
				can be changed anythime
			proj number
				unique proj number 
				used by google to keep track resources

	3. Folders

			- getting highest uptimes for interconnection
		
	4. Partner Interconnect
		- provides connectivity between onprimes and VPC network through supported ISP
		When to use
			- on premise DC can't connect to colocation DC
			- dat dont neet an entire 10 GB per second conenction
			- support critical services or app that can tolerate downtime
		
	5. Cross Cloud Interconnect
		- establish high BW dedicated connectivity bet google cloud and another cloud service provider
		- available in 10GbpS or 100Gbps

		- Cloud interconnect/AWS Direct connect
			- a private hallway comm between onpremise or google cloud
				- on premise  and google cloud connects through colocation facility using BGP bet Cloud router and onpremise router

		2. Explore VPC Networking. 
		3. Implement Private Google Access and Cloud NAT

	VPC 
		- an isolated/private network where you can define IP address range to be used for your resources

	Projects, Networks and Subnetworks

		Projects
			- associates objects and services with billing
			- 15 networks

		Networks
			- can be shared with outher projects or be peered with VPC peering

			CIDR(classless inter-domain routing)
				- ways of splitting network to a smaller network called subnet
				- method for allocating IP addr

		Types
			Default
				- every project
				- one subnet per region
				- default firewall rules

				Auto Mode
					- Default network
					- one subnet per region
					- regional IP allocation
					- fixed /20 subnet per region
					- expandable upto /16

			Custom Mode
				- no default subnets created
				- full control of IP ranges
				- Regional IP allocation
				- Expandable to IP ranges

			Subnetworks
				- smaller network from splitted network
				- works on regional level
				- cross zone is possible
					- single FW rule can be applied to both VMs
				- 4 reserves IP addrs compares to AW which has 5
					- first
						- network addr
					- second
						- subnet's gateway
					- last
						- broadcast addr
					- ip before last
						- - broadcast addr

				-subnet mask
					- allows part of undelying IP to get add next values from next base IP

					Rules
						- cannot overlap with other subnets
						- ip range must be unique valid CIDR block
						- new subnet IP ranges have to all within valid IP ranges
						- can expand but not shrink
						- auto mode can be expanded from /20 to /16

			Notes
				- Same VMs located in same network can communicate using private addr
				- Two VMs in different network can comm with their private addr if using Google Edge routers/VPN
					- diff bill and security risks

			Expand Subnet
				- change sider notation to lesser number

				/29
					4 instances

				/24
					256-4= 252 instances

				/23
					508 instances

	IP Addresses
		Internal IP 
			- allocated from subnet range to VMs by DHCP
		
		DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) 
			- allows hosts to automatically learn various netwokr w/o manual static config 
			- automatically learn address of DNS server 
			- DHCP lease is renewed every 24 hrs 
			- VM name + IP is registered with network-scoped DNS 
			
		IPV4 ranges
			10.0.0.0/8
			10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
			172.16.0.0/12
			172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
			192.168.0.0/16
			192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

			External IP
				- assigned from pool(ephemeral/temporary)
				- reserved(static)
				- bring your own IP address(BYOIP)
				- VM doesn't know external IP
					- It is mapped to the internal IP

			Quotas/limits of instance per network
				- 15,000 VM

	Maopping IP addresses
		External IPs are mapped to internal IP

		Two types of internal DNS
			- Zonal(preferred)
			- Global

		Note
			- DNS name always poins to specific instance no matterr what internal IP addr is.

		Cloud DNS
			- google's DNS service
			- 100& uptome SLA
			- create and update millions of DNS records

		Alias IP range
			When to use
				- multiple service running on a VM and want assigh diff IP addr to each service

	Routes and Firewall Rules
		Cloud Routes \
		- defines the paths that network traffic takes from a virtual machine (VM) instance to other destination(same VPC network or outside).

		GCP Firewall Rules/Security group
			- stateful that allow/deny connections to or from your VM instances
			- Ipmlied deny all ingress and allow all egress by default
			- applited tot he network as a whole

			Use case(Egress)
				- Going out
				- VM to internet
				- VM to VM

				Conditions
					- Desination CIDR ranges
					- Protocols
					- Ports

				Action:
					Allow
						- permit the matching egress connection

					Deny
						- block the matching egress connection

			Use case(Egress)
				- Going in
				- internet to VM
				- VM to VM

				Conditions
					- Source CIDR ranges
					- Protocols
					- Ports

				Action:
					Allow
						- permit the matching egress connection

					Deny
						- block the matching egress connection

	Pricing
		Network Pricing
			No charge 
				- Ingress 
				- egress to same zone(internal IP) 
				- egress to google products like maps/drive/youtube 
				- egress to dif cloud service within same region 
				- Staic and ephemeral external IP addr atttached to forwarding rules used by Cloud NAT/VPN tunnel

			Charge
				- egress to same zome(External IP per GB)
				- egress bet regions within US and CANADA(per GB)
				- egress between zones in the same region(per GB)
				- static external IP addr assigned but unused
				- static and ephemeral external IP addr used on standard VM instances
				- static and ephemeral IP add in use on preemptible VM instance

			Note
				Use Google CLoud Pricing Calculator

		Which instances should you be able to ping from mynet-us-vm using internal IP addresses?
			- mynet-eu-vm
				- same VPC network called mynet eventhough seprate zones,regions and continents can communicate

		Review
			- VPC networks are by default isolated private networking domains. 
			Therefore, no internal IP address communication is allowed between networks, 
			unless you set up mechanisms such as VPC peering or VPN.

Common Network Designs
	1. Availability and Disaster Recovery
		- Increased availibility with multiple zones
			- Two Vm instances in one network, subnet and region but different zone
		
		- Globalization with multiple regions
			- Two VM in same network, diff subnet, region and zone

	2. Security
		- Cloud NAT provides internet access to private instances
			Scenario
				One region
					- 2 Instances in different subnet
					- only use Internal IP and no Exteranl IP to make it private
					- use cloud NAT for egress access internet such as update/patching/config management server
						Cloud NAT	
							- managed network address translation service
							- does not allow ingress traffic
							- Keep VPC isolated and secured
		
		- Private Google Access to Google APIs and services
			- uses VPC Routing to allow communication between VM in different region in the same network
			- enable private Google access to allow VM instance  to reach external IP addr of Google APIs and services
				- Private VM instance need access to GCS bucket
				- Private Google Access
					- subnet level
					- only internal IP and no effect on external IP

	Qwiklabs - Implement Private Google Access and Cloud NAT
	https://googlecoursera.qwiklabs.com/focuses/34735427?parent=lti_session
	
	Objectives
		In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
			1. Configure a VM instance that does not have an external IP address
			2. Connect to a VM instance using an Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) tunnel
			3. Enable Private Google Access on a subnet
			4. Configure a Cloud NAT gateway
			5. Verify access to public IP addresses of Google APIs and services and other connections to the internet

		VM Instance creation
			- VM instance have ephemeral external IP bu default
				- can be cahnge in policy constraint at org/project level

		// SSH connectivity gcloud
			gcloud compute ssh vm-internal --zone us-east1-d --tunnel-through-iap

		Note:
			No external IP addr	
				- an only be reached by other instances on the network via a managed VPN gateway or via a Cloud IAP tunnel
			Cloud IAP 
				- enables context-aware access to VMs via SSH and RDP without bastion hosts

			Currently, which of your VM instances can access the image from your bucket?
				- Cloud Shell through SSH

			If Private Google Access is ON on subnet level
				- VM with only internal IP can only update for Google Ckloud packages or Google APIs and services

			Cloud NAT gateway	
				- implements outbound NAT, but not inbound NAT. 
				- in other words, hosts outside of your VPC network can only respond to connections initiated by your instances; 
				they cannot initiate their own, new connections to your instances via NAT.

			Cloud NAT logging
				- allows you to log NAT connections and errors. When Cloud NAT logging is enabled, one log entry can be generated for each of the following scenarios:
					- When a network connection using NAT is created.
					- When a packet is dropped because no port was available for NAT.
				
			For  Configure and view logs with Cloud NAT Logging pls refer to the qwiklab link above

	Quiz
	1. In Google Cloud, what is the minimum number of I addresses that a VM instance needs?
		- One: Only an internal IP address
	2. What are the three types of networks offered in Google Cloud?
		- Default network, auto network, and custom network.
	3. What is one benefit of applying firewall rules by tag rather than by address?
		- When a VM is created with a matching tag, the firewall rules apply irrespective of the IP address it is assigned.
			- ephemeral external IP addr is random that is why we use tag to make it simple and assigning match FW rules

					- gcloud CLi
		
	Images
		Public base images
			- Google
			- third party vendors
			- premium images(p)
			- Linux
			- windows

		Custom images
			- create new image from VM: pre-configured and installed SW
			- import from:
				- on-premium
				- workstation
				- another cloud
			- features	
				- image sharing/family/deprecation

		Machine Images
			- stores all:
					- config
					- metadata
					- permission
					- data from one or more disks
			- uses mainly in maintenance scenario such as instance cloning/replication/disk backups/recovery 

		Note:
			- Premium images(p) are charges per second after a 1 minute mon except SQL server images(charged after 10 min)

	Disk options
		Boot disk
			- VM comes w/ single root persistent disk from base image
				- avoid delete
					- disable delete boot disk when instance is deleted

		Persistent disks
			- network storage appearing as a block device
			- attached to VM through the network interface and not physically attached to the machine
			- can survice VM terminate
			- bootable means attach to VM and boot from it
			- spnapshots
			- scales with size
			- HDD or SSD options
			- disk rezising even running and attached
			- can be attached in read only mode
			- Zonal
				- reliable block storage
			- regional
				Usecase
				High availability/perfomance DB
					- active active across two zones
						- sync replication across zones
			- types
				1. pd-standard Disks
					- uses HDD
					- large data processing workloads uses sequential I/Os
					- large capacity only needed
				2. pd-SSD
					- perfomance SSD
					- enterprise app and high performance DB that req latency and more IOPS than pd-standard
				3. pd-balanced
						- uses SSD
						- max IOPS nad lower IOpS per GB
						- genearal purpose app bet pd-standard and pd-SSD
				4. pd-extreme
						- uses SSD
						- zonal only
						- highend DB workloads
						- high perforamnce for:
							- random access workloads an
							- bulk throughput
			Encrption keys
				- Google-managed
				- Cusotmer-managed
					- use CLoud key Management service
				- Customer-supplied
					- Customer-supplied encryption keys

		Local SSD
			- very high IOPS, lower latency, and higher througput than persistent disk
				- but ephemeral
			- physically attached to a VM
			- 375 GBdisk upto 24, totla of 9TB per instance
			- Data services reset but not VM stop or terminate	
			- w/o data redundancy
				
		RAM disk
			- tmfs
				- store data in memory 
			- faster than local disk but slower than memory	
				- use when app expects file sys structure and cannot directly store its data in memory
			- very volatile means erase on stop or restart
				- ephemeral
			- may need larger machine type if RAM was sized for the app
			- consider using persistent disk to back up RAM disk data

			Recommendation
				- use tmfs for fastest performance for small data structures
				- use for high memory VM along with persistent disk to back up RAM disk data

		Limitation
			Shared core machine type
				 - can only attach upto 16 disks
			standard/high memory/high CPU/memory-optimized/Compute-optimized
					- 128

		Note
			- Throughput is limited by number of compress
				- shares same BW w/ Disk IOPS
				- compete with any network egress/ingress throughput

			- Compute Hardware Disk
				- grow size
					- repartition
				- changes	
					- reformat
				- redundancy	
					- create redundant disk array
				- encryption
					- encrypt fiels before writing them to the disk
			
			- Cloud Persistent disks
				- simply grow disks and resize
					- virtual networked devices
				- redundancy
					- Snapshot
				- encryption
					- auto encrypted
				- Confidential
					- we can use own keys so no one can get data except us
				

			



	Common Compute Engine actions
		metadata	
			- useful for startup and shutdown scripts
				- use metadata server w/o additional authorization to get unique infor

		Moving instance within same region
			- automate the move by using gcloud command
				- gcloud comput instances move
			- update references to VM cuz it's not automatic
				- target VMs
				- target pools
			- process
				- shutdown
				- move to dest zone
				- restart

		Moving instance to diff region
			- process	
				- snapshot all persistent disk
					- custom image
				- create disk from that image in the new region
				- create new VM from that region
				- attach that snapshot
				- assign static external IP
				-  update references to new VM
				- delete previous VM/disks/snapshot
		
		Snapshot
			- stored in GCS
				- not visible in your buckets cuz manage by the snapshot service
			- spnapshots are incremental and automatically compress 
				- means next snapshot will only copy the changes after the first snapshot
			
			Usage	
				- backup critical data for availability and drive
				- improve disk performance such us from HDD to SSD
					- resizing disk to improve I/O performance 
			
			Note
				- not applicable to local SSD
				- can grow disks in size but can never shrink them
				- snapshot doesn't backup VM metadata, tags and et.

		Recommendation
			- store startip/shutdown scripts in GCS

Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services

Learning Objectives
	1. Understand how to navigate the course
	2. Understand how to download course resources

Module 1 - Identity and Access Management(IAM)
	- Administer Identity and Access Management for resources

	Learning Objectives
		1. Describe the IAM resource hierarchy
		2. Explain the different types of IAM roles
		3. Recall the different types of IAM members
		4. Implement access control for resources using IAM

	Identity and Access Management
		- identiyfying who can do what on which resources
		who
			- IAM member
		what
			- roles
				- permissions
		resources
			- Google cloud service

	

	Organization
		- root node for google cloud hierarchy
		- when workspace domain/identity accoun creates project, their domain name will be the name of their organization
		Roles
			Workspace/Cloud Identity super admin
				- assign the organization admin role to some users
				- be the point of contact in case of recovery issues
				- control the lifecycle of the workspace or cloud identity accound and organization resource
			- organization admin
				- control over all cloud resources
				- useful for auditing
				- define IAM policies
				- determine structure of the resource hierarchy
				- delegate responsibility over critical components such as 
					- networking
					- billing
					- resource hierarchy through IAM roles
			- project creator
				- controls project creation
				- control over who can create projects
	Folders
		- where you can isolate department -> teams -> products  or shared Infrastructure
		- allow delegation of adnmin rights

	projects
		- enabled: 
			- services, 
			- api, 
			- billing, 
			- add/remove collaborator
	
	Resource Manager Roles
		Organization
			- admin
				- full control over all resources
			- view access to all resources

		Folders
			- admin
				- full control over folders
			- creator
				- browse hierarchy and create folders
			- viewer
				- view folders and projects below a resource
		projects
			creator
				- create new projects(automatic owner) and migrate new projects into organization
			deleter
				- delete projects
	roles
		- offers fixed level access
			- owner
				- full admin access
				- invite members
				- remove members
				- delete projects
			- editor
				- deploy app
				- modify code
				- config services 
			- viewer
				- read only acess
			- billing admin
				- manage billing
				- add and remove admin
				- no rights change resources in the project
		Three types	
			1. Basic
				- owner
				- editor
				- viewer 
			2. Predefined
				- apply to aparticular google cloud service
				why	
					- grouping permissions into a role makes it easier to manage

				Sample
					Compute Engine
						- Compute admin role	
							- full control of all compute engine resources
						- Network admin role	
							- permission to create/modify/delete network resources
							- only read access to FW ruless SSL cert
							- read access to ephemeral IP addr too
					Cloud storage	
						- storage admin role
							- create/modify/delete disks/images/snapshots
							- given to manages project images without editing having edior role
			3. Custom
				When to use
					- Implementing least privileged model

	members
		- define who cand do what on wchich resources

	Types
		1. Google account
			- developer/admin/person who interacts with google cloud

		2. Service account	
			- an account that belongs to your app instead of an indiv end user
		3. Google group
			- name collection of google accounts and servic accouns
		4. Workspace domain
			- rep org internet domain
			- rep virtual group of all google accounts that have been created in an org workspace acct

		5. Cloud IAP
				- let users who don't have workspace domain manage users and groups using google admin console like wokspace domain

	IAM policies
		- policy consists of list of bindings
		- bindin bind a list of members to a role
			- role
				- named list of permissions defined by IAM 
	
	IAM allow policies
		- grant access to cloud resources
		- control access to the resource itself, as well as any descendants of that resource
		- associates, binds, one or more prinicpials(also known as a member or identity) w/ single IAM role

	IAM deny policies
		- deny rules prevent certain principals from using certain permissions, regardless of the roles they're granted
		- deny policies are made up of deny rules. Each deny rule spcifies:
			- a set of principals that are denied permissions
			- permissions that the principals are denied/unable to use
			- optional: condition that must be true for the permission to be denied
		- when principal is denied a permission, they can't do anything that requires that permission
	
	IAM Conditions	
		- enforce conditional, attribute-based access control for google resources
			- grant resource access to identities(members) only if config conditions are met
			- specified in the role bindings of a resource's IAM policy

	Organizaiton policies
		- config of Restrictions
		- defined by configuring a constraint w/ desired Restrictions
		- applied to the organization node, folders or projects
		
	Corporate directory migrations
		Microsft AD or LDAP -> Google Cloud Directory Sync -> Users and groups in your Cloud Identity domain
		
	Single sign-on(SSO)
		- use cloud identity to config SAML SSO
		- if SAML2 isn't supported, use a third party solution(ADFS, Ping, or OKTA)

	Note:
		- cannot use IAM to create or manage your users/groups
		- less restrictive parent policy will always ovverride more restrictive polociy
		- chose smallest scope
		- use role Recommendation to lessen excess permission
		- deny policies first before allow policies

	Service Accounts
		- an account that belongs to your cloud resources instead of an indiv end user
			- assistant robot that has secure access resources w/o using personal user credentials
		- identity for carrying out service to service interactions

		Types: 
			1. user-created(custom)
			2. built-in	
				- compute engine default service accounts
				- app engine default service accounts
			3. Google APIs service account
				- run internal google processes on your behalf

		When to use
			- convenient when you're not accessing user data
			- provisioning resources with terraform
			- App that interacrts with Google Cloud Storage 
	
		scopes
			- used to determine whether an authenticated identity is authorized
			- can be changed after an instance is created

		How it works?
			- programs running w/in compute engine instances can automatically acquire access tokens w/ credentials
				- tokens are used to access any service API in your project and any other services that granted access to that service account
		
		Service account permissions
			- default service accounts
				- basic roles
				- predefined roles
			- user created service accounts
				- predefined roles
			- roles for service accounts can be assigned ot gorup or users

		How service accounts authenticated?
		Two types of service account keys	
			1. Google-managed service accounts
				- all service accounts have google-managed keys
				- google stores both the public and private portion of the key
				- each public key can be used for signing for a maximum of two weeks
				- private keys are never directly accessible
			2. User managed service accounts
				- google only stores the public portion of a user managed key
				- users are responsible for private key security
				- can create upto 10 user-managed service account keys per service
				- can be administered via the IAM API, gcloud, or the console

		Note	
			- Each service has scopes
			- for user created service accounts, use IAM roles instead
			- google doesn't save user-managed private keys so they can't recover them
				- key rotation is managed by customer also

	Organization Restrictions
		- prevent data exfiltration through phishing or insider attacks
			- restricts access only to resources for authorized Google Cloud Organizations

		How it works?
			Managed Device(governed by company policies)
				-> Customer managed Egress proxy(Egress proxy admin  config proxy to add org restricitions headers to any req originating from managed device)
					-> Google Cloud Org/Vendor Google CLoud Org
						-> Cloud Storage


	IAM Best Practices
		1. Leverage and understand the resource hierarchy
			- use projects to group resources that share the same trust boundary
			- check the policy granted on each resource and make sure you understand the inheritance
			- use "principles of least privelege" when granting roles
			- audit policies in Cloud Audit Logs: setiampolicy
			- audit membership of groups used in policies
		2. Grant roles to Google groups instead of individuals
			- update group membership instead of changing IAM policy
			- audit membership of groups used in policies
			- control the ownership of the google group used in IAM policies
		3. Service Accounts Best Practices
			- Be very careful granting serviceAccountUser role
			- When you create a service account, give it a display name that cleary identifies its purpos
			- Establish a naming convention for service Accounts
			- Establish key rotation policies and methods
			- Audit w/ serviceAccount.keys.list() method
		4. Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy(IAP)
			- establish central authorization layer for app accessed by https
				- app level access control model instead of network level firewalls
					- means no VPN
			- enforce access control policies for app and resources:
				- identity-based access control
				- central authorization layer for app accessed by https
			- a security guard for your web app that controls access based on users identity/authenication and permission/authorization
			
		Note
				- IAM policy is applied after authentication.

Module 2 - Storage and Database Services
	- Implement data storage services in Google Cloud

	Learning Objectives
		1. Differentiate between Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Firestore and Cloud Bigtable
		2. Choose a data storage service based on your requirements
		3. Implement data storage services

	Scope
		Infrastructure Track
			- Service differentiators
			- When to consider using each service
			- Set up and connect to a service
		
		Data Engineering Track
			- How to use a database system
			- Design, organization, structure, schema and use for an application
			- Details about how a service stores and retrieves structured data

	Cloud Storage
		- cloud's object storage.
			- a collection ob buckets that you place objects into
			- uses URL to access objects
		
		structure
			buckets(globally unique name)
				-> object
		Use case	
			- website content
			- storing data for archiing and DR
			- Distributing large data objects to users via direct download

		Key features
			- Scalable to exabytes

			- Time to first byte in milliseconds
			- Very high availbility across all storage classes
			- Single API across storage classes

		Classes
			1. Standard
				- frequently accessed data(hot)
				- stored for only brief period of time
				- no minimum storage duration and no retrieval constrain

				When to use
					- store data in same region as GKE clusters/GCE instance that uses it

			2. Nearline
				- infrequently accessed data like
					- data backup
					- long-tail multimedia content
					- data archiving
				- once a month

				When to use
					- lower availability than standard
					- 30 day min storage duration
					- costs for data access are acceptable trade-offs for lowered at-rest storage costs

			3. Coldline
				- cheaper infrequently accessed data than nearline
				- once in a 90 days
				When to use
					- lower availability than those 2 above
					- 90 day minimum storage duration
					- higher cost for data access are acceptable trade-offs for lowered at-rest storage costs

			4. Archive
				- once a year archiving storage data
				When to use
					- lowest cost
					- data archiving
					- online backup
					- DR
					- coldest service but data can be retrieved w/in milliseconds at higher expense
					- 365 day minimum storage duration
		
		Durability
			11 nines percent

		Location Types
			1. Multi-region
				- geo redundant
				- use for data serving around the world
					- website content
					- streaming videos
					- executing interactive workloads
					- serving data supporting mobile and gaming applicaionts
			2. Dual-Region
				- geo redundant
				- availability and DR

			3. Region
				- use w/ GKE/GCE instance that access it's data

		Modify after creation
			- can change storage data type
			- can't change location type
			- can change per object storage type/class
			- default class of bucket is applied to a new objects
			- objects can be moved from bucket to bucket
			- Object lifecycle Management
					- manage the classes of objects in your bucket
						- like s3 Intel tiering but on object level
					- with delete feature

		Security
			1. IAM
			2. Access control lists/ACL
				- for custom finer control
					- define who has access level to buckets/object
				- number entries is 100
					- scope	
						- define who(group/user) can perform specific action
							- collaborator@gmail.com
							- allUsers
								- anyone who is on the internet
							- allAuthenticatedUsers
								- represents anyone who is authenticated w/ google account
					- permission
						- define what actions(Read/write) can be performed
			3. Signed URLs
				- for more detailed control for granting internet user who don't use google account
					- means time-limited access to a bucket/object
				- "Valet key" access to buckets and objects via ticket:
					- Ticket is a cryptographically signed URL
					- Time-limited
					- Operations specified in ticket: HTTP/GET/PUT/DELETE and not POST
					- Any user with URL can invoke permitted operations

				Signed Policy documents
					- for determining what kind of file can be uploaded by someone w/ signed URL
				- URL is signed using private key associated w/ service account
					- service account delegates its trust of the account to the holder of the URL
				
				Note
					- signed URL expiration should be a reasonable time

	Cloud Storage features
		1. Customer-Supplied Encryption Key(CSEK)
			- use your own key instead of Google managed keys
		2. Object Lifeccyle management
			- automatically delete/archive objects
		3. Object versioning
			- maintain multiple versions of objects
				- charged each versions as if they were multiple files
			- supports retrieval of objects that are deleted or overwritten
			- maintain a history of modifications of objects
				- older version is stored in archive with added generation number to its name
				- turning it off will retain archive stored
			- list archived versions of an object, restore an object to an older state/delete a version
			
			Support configuration
				- object inspection occurs in asynchronous batches
				- changes can take 24 hrs to apply
				
				When to use
					- downgrade storage class on objects older than a year/archiving older versions of objects/downgrading
						- downgrade to coldline for older than ayear
					- delete objects created before a specific date
					- keep only the 3 most recent versions of an object
			
		4. Directory synchronization
			- synchronizes a VM directory w/ a bucket
		5. Object change notifications using Pub/Sub
		6. Autoclass
			- manages all aspects of storage class for  a bucket

		Notes
			- objects are immutable means uploaded object cannot be modified
		
		database import services
		  - use for transfering petabytes/terabytes
			- Transfer Appliance/Snowcone-Snowmobile
				- rack, capture and then ship your data to google cloud
			- Storage transfer service
				- import online data through online
			- Offline Media Import
				- Third party provider uploads the data from physical media

		Global consistency
			- read after write
			- read after metadata-update
			- read after delete
			- bucket listing
			- object listing

	Choosing a storage class
		Structured Data
			- choose DB services
		
		Unstructured Data
			- choose GCS
				- Read < once a year
					- archive
				- Read once per 90 days
					- coldline
				- Read once per 30 days
					- nearline
				- Read less than 30 days
					- standard
				
				Location type
					- Region
						- same as customer for:
							- less latency and optimize network BW for data consumers
								- analytics pipelines grouped in same region
					- Dual region
						- want same performance as region with higher availability(geo-redundant)
					- Multi-region
						- serve content to data consumers outside of google network and distributed across large geographic areas
						- higher data availibility that comes with being geo-redundant

				- Autoclass
					- bucket level
					- like Amazon s3 Intelligent- Tiering
						- auto cost savings by moving objects between tiers based on access patterns.		
					- variety of access frequencies/unknown/predictible
					- No charged	
						- storage class transitions
						- no retrieval charges
						- no early deleteion charges
	
	Qwiklabs: Cloud Storage
		https://googlecoursera.qwiklabs.com/focuses/34814610?parent=lti_session
	
	Objectives
		In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
			- Create and use buckets

cat acl3.txt

		Customer-supplied encryption keys(CSEK)
			// Create a CSEK: AES-256 base-64 key
				python3 -c 'import base64; import os; 
				print(base64.encodebytes(os.urandom(32)))'

			//generate boto file
				gsutil config -n

			// check gsutil version
				gsutil version -l 

			// copy the key to boto fole encryption key variable
			 encryption_key=2dAtVPvt9dCVKPkilGPcRGtlrXQ1C0gFgJrl8/XVWDY=

		Rotate CSEK keys
			// use above key for decryption_key1
				decryption_key1=2dAtVPvt9dCVKPkilGPcRGtlrXQ1C0gFgJrl8/XVWDY=

			// generate new key for encryption_key and update .boto file
				encryption_key=ZougR707S+PRRMOjLGDOcNk2spvJ+H6mumVqom7yqnU=

			// rewrite the key for file 1/setup2 and comment out the old decrypt key
				gsutil rewrite -k gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup2.html

			// view current lifecycle policy 
				gsutil lifecycle get gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1

			// Create JSOn lifecycle policy file
				vi life.json
					{
						"rule":
						[
							{
								"action": {"type": "Delete"},
								"condition": {"age": 31}
							}
						]
					}
			
			// set policy

			// check of enable versioning is enabled
				gsutil versioning get gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1

			// enable versioning
				gsutil versioning set on gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1

		Create serveral versions of sample file in bucket
			//delete five lines
			from 59 kb to 57.1kb
			
			//upload to GCS bucket
				gcloud storage cp -v setup.html gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1
			
			//list all versions of the file
				gcloud storage ls -a gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup.html

			//oldest
			gs://bineliasray1/setup.html#1710722349381314
			
			//newest
			gs://bineliasray1/setup.html#1710723107639739

		Synchronize a directory and sync w/ a bucket
			//Make a nested directory structure so that you can examine what happens when it is recursively copied to a bucket.
				mkdir firstlevel
				mkdir ./firstlevel/secondlevel
				cp setup.html firstlevel
				cp setup.html firstlevel/secondlevel

			//To sync the firstlevel directory on the VM with your bucket, run the following command:
				gsutil rsync -r ./firstlevel gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/firstlevel

			//Verify
				gcloud storage ls -r gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/firstlevel

		Cross-project sharing
			//Create service account in project 2

			//Verify by connecting to it from a VM in project 1
				//upload key creadential.json
				//authorize VM
					gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file credentials.json

				//verify access
					//list object in buckets
					gcloud storage ls gs://$BUCKET_NAME_2/

					//upload file to bucket 2
					gcloud storage cp credentials.json gs://$BUCKET_NAME_2/

		Qwiklabs - Implementing Cloud SQL
			https://googlecoursera.qwiklabs.com/focuses/34832957?parent=lti_session

			Objectives
			In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

				1. Create a Cloud SQL database
				2. Configure a virtual machine to run a proxy
				3. Create a connection between an application and Cloud SQL
				4. Connect an application to Cloud SQL using Private IP address

				username
					student-04-b93d4607a686@qwiklabs.net
				password
					CqNhmzDiQLg5

				//A few points to consider for machine type config:
					1. Shared-core machines are good for prototyping, and are not covered by Cloud SLA.
					2. Each vCPU is subject to a 250 MB/s network throughput cap for peak performance. Each additional core increases the network cap, up to a theoretical maximum of 2000 MB/s.
					3. For performance-sensitive workloads such as online transaction processing (OLTP), a general guideline is to ensure that your instance has enough memory to contain the entire working set and accommodate the number of active connections.

				//A few points to consider for storage config:
					1. SSD (solid-state drive) is the best choice for most use cases. HDD (hard-disk drive) offers lower performance, but storage costs are significantly reduced, so HDD may be preferable for storing data that is infrequently accessed and does not require very low latency.
					2. There is a direct relationship between the storage capacity and its throughput.

			Configure a proxy on a virtual machine
				Two VM
					one Wordpress VM private IP
					one worpress proxy VM
						//Download the Cloud SQL Proxy and make it executable
							wget https://dl.google.com/cloudsql/cloud_sql_proxy.linux.amd64 -O cloud_sql_proxy && chmod +x cloud_sql_proxy

				Cloud SQL instance
					//Instance connection name
						qwiklabs-gcp-00-8103347d7842:us-east1:wordpress-db

					//To activate the proxy connection to your Cloud SQL database and send the process to the background, run the following command:
					./cloud_sql_proxy -instances=$SQL_CONNECTION=tcp:3306 &

				Connect an application to the Cloud SQL instance
					//Configure the Wordpress application. To find the external IP address of your virtual machine, query its metadata:
						curl -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google" http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/network-interfaces/0/access-configs/0/external-ip && echo

				Connect to Cloud SQL via internal IP
					Note
						- host your application in the same region and VPC connected network as your Cloud SQL, you can leverage a more secure and performant configuration using Private IP.
						- Notice that this time you are creating a direct connection to a Private IP, instead of configuring a proxy. That connection is private, which means that it doesn't egress to the internet and therefore benefits from better performance and security.

					//private IP
						10.58.0.2

				Overview
					you created a Cloud SQL database and configured it to use both an external connection over a secure proxy and a Private IP address, which is more secure and performant. Remember that you can only connect via Private IP if the application and the Cloud SQL server are collocated in the same region and are part of the same VPC network. If your application is hosted in another region, VPC, or even project, use a proxy to secure its connection over the external connection.

        - high availability cloud VPN sol'n that lets you securely connect on-premise network 
          to your VPC network through an IPsec VPN connection in a single region.
        - SLA if 99.99% service availability

        Supports site-to-site VPN for different topologies/configuration scenarios:
          - An HA VPN gateway to peer VPN devices
          - An HA VPN gateway to an AWS virtual private gateway
          - Two HA VPN gateways connected to each other

        How for Google Cloud to On-premise?
          - Cloud HA VPN Gateway
            - google cloud auto chooses two external IP
               - supports multiple tunnels
          - Cloud Router
          - Two on premise VPN gateway
          - Two or four VPN tunnels
            - serves as the virtual medium through IPsec encrypted data
            - must be paired
            - VPN tunnels connected to HA VPN gateways must use dynamic(BGP) routing
              - active/active routing configurations
              - active/passive routing configurations

        How for Google Cloud to AWS Cloud?
          - two tunnels from AWS TGW/VPG to one interface of HA cloud VPN gateway
          - other two tunnels from AWS TGW/VPG to second interface of same HA cloud VPN gateway

    HA VPN

    Qwiklab: Configuring Google Cloud HA VPN
      https://googlecoursera.qwiklabs.com/focuses/34859444?parent=lti_session
      - HA VPN is a high-availability (HA) Cloud VPN solution that lets you securely connect your on-premises network to your VPC network through an IPsec VPN connection in a single region. HA VPN provides an SLA of 99.99% service availability.
      - HA VPN is a regional per VPC, VPN solution. HA VPN gateways have two interfaces, each with its own public IP address. When you create an HA VPN gateway, two public IP addresses are automatically chosen from different address pools. When HA VPN is configured with two tunnels, Cloud VPN offers a 99.99% service availability uptime.
      - In this lab you create a global VPC called vpc-demo, with two custom subnets in us-east4 and us-central1. 
        In this VPC, you add a Compute Engine instance in each region. 
        You then create a second VPC called on-prem to simulate a customer's on-premises data center. 
        In this second VPC, you add a subnet in region us-central1 and a Compute Engine instance running in this region. 
        Finally, you add an HA VPN and a cloud router in each VPC and run two tunnels from each HA VPN gateway before testing the configuration to verify the 99.99% SLA.

      Objectives
      In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

        1. Create two VPC networks and instances.
        2. Configure HA VPN gateways.
        3. Configure dynamic routing with VPN tunnels.
        4. Configure global dynamic routing mode.
        5. Verify and test HA VPN gateway configuration.

        - Each of the tunnels from each interface on the Cloud VPN gateway must be connected to its own peer gateway.
      A single on-premises VPN gateway device with two interfaces
        - Each of the tunnels from each interface on the Cloud VPN gateway must be connected to its own interface on the peer gateway.
      A single on-premises VPN gateway device with a single interface
        - Both of the tunnels from each interface on the Cloud VPN gateway must be connected to the same interface on the peer gateway.

Module 2 - Load Balancing and Autoscaling
  - Configure load balancers and autoscaling for VM instances

  Learning Objectives
    1. Recall the various load balancing services
    2. Determine which Google Cloud load balancer to use in specific circumstances
    3. Describe autoscaling behavior, policies, configuration, and metrics
    4. Configure load balancers and autoscaling
    
  Managed Instance Groups
    - a collection of identical VM instances that you control as a single entity using an instance template
    - deploy identical instances based on instance template
    - instance group can be resized
    - manager ensures all instances are running
    - typically used w/ autoscaler
    - can be single zone or regional

    Autoscaling and health checks
      - allows you to auto add/remove instances from a MIG based on load

      Autoscaling policies supports
        - CPU utilization
        - load balancing capacity
        - monitoring metrics
        - queue-based workload like Pub/Sub 
        - schedule such as start-time, duration and recurrence

      Health checks
        - similar to uptime check in stackdriver

        Setup?
          - Protocol
          - ports
          - health criteria:
              1. timeout_sec
                - How long to wait (in seconds) before a request is considered a failure
              2. check_interval_sec
                - how often in seconds to check whether an instance is healthy
              3. healthy_threshold
                - How many consecutive successes must occur to mark a VM instance healthy.
              4 .unhealthy_threshold
                - How many consecutive failures must occur to mark a VM instance unhealthy

  HTTP(S) Load Balancing
    - acts at layer7/application layer of OSI model
      - deals w/ actual content of each message and allows routing decision based on unhealthy_threshold
    - provides global load balancing
    - anyacast IP addr
    - HTTP on port 80/8080
    - HTTPs on port 443
    - supports ipv4 and ipv6 clients
    - autoscaling
      - no pre-warming and enables content-based and cross regiona load balamncing
    - url maps
      - route some URLs to one set of instance like distributing them
      - req are generally routed to instance group near to the user 
    
    Architecture of an HTTP load balancer
      Internet -> Global Forwarding rule -> Target Proxy -> URL map
      -> Backend Service(Constantly checked by Health Check) -> Instance Group -> 
    
      Global Forwarding rule
        - directs incoming requests from the internet to a target HTTP Proxy.
      
      Target HTTP Proxy
        - checks each request against a URL map to determine appropriate backend service

      Backend Service
        - directs each request to an appropriate instance  based on serving capacity, zone/location and instance health
        - contains:
          - health check
            - only instances that pass health check are allowed to receive new requests
          - sesson affinity
            - attempts to send all req from the same client to same virtual machine instance
          - timeout settings(30 sec by default)
            - amt of time backend service will wait on backend before considering req is a failure
          - one or more backends
            - an instance group(managed or unmanaged)
            - a balancing mode(CPU utilization or RPS)
              - tells load balancing sys how to det when backend is at full usage
            - A capacity scaler(ceiling percentage of CPU/Rate targets)
              - additional control w/ balancing mode settings
                - 80% CPU utilization and 100% capacity
                - 80% CPU utilization and 50% capacity

    Distributing Algorithm used are
      1. Round robin
        - use by default to distribute requests among available instances.

    Cross-Region  LB
      - backend service in 2 or more region

    Content-Based LB
      - url map split traffic based on content(video/web traffic)

    HTTPS LB
      - same structure of HTTP LB but uses target HTTPS proxy instead of HTTP proxy.
      - reuires at least one signed SSL cert installed
        - upto 15 SSL cert per target proxy
      - client SSL session terminates at the LB
      - support the QUIC transport layer Protocol
        QUIC transport layer Protocol
          - quick UPD internet connections allows faster client connections
          - lower latncy because eliminates head of line blocking multiplexed stream
          - supports connection migration when client's IP addr changes

      Network endpoint groups(NEG)
        - a config object that specifies a group of backend endpoints/services
          - cloud run/app engine/function
            - serverless neg means dno endpoints
          Internet NEG
            - contains single endpoint  specified by IP addr hosted outside google cloud

    Qwiklab: Configuring an HTTP load balancer w/ autoscaling
      https://googlecoursera.qwiklabs.com/focuses/34883910?parent=lti_session
      - Google Cloud HTTP(S) load balancing is implemented at the edge of Google's network in Google's points of presence (POP) around the world. 
        User traffic directed to an HTTP(S) load balancer enters the POP closest to the user and is then load-balanced over Google's global network to the closest backend that has sufficient available capacity.

      - In this lab, you configure an HTTP load balancer as shown in the diagram below. 
        Then, you stress test the load balancer to demonstrate global load balancing and autoscaling.

      Objectives
      In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

        1. Create a health check firewall rule
        2. Create a NAT configuration using Cloud Router
        3. Create a custom image for a web server
        4. Create an instance template based on the custom image
        5. Create two managed instance groups
        6. Configure an HTTP load balancer with IPv4 and IPv6
        7. Stress test an HTTP load balancer

      The HTTP load balancer should forward traffic to the region that is closest to you.
        - yes

      //To place a load on the load balancer, run the following command:
      ab -n 500000 -c 1000 http://$LB_IP/
    
  Cloud CDN(Content Delivery Network)
    - cached content at CDN nodes/Edge PoPs near to your users for faster response

    Cloud CDN cache modes
      - control the factors that determine whether or not Cloud CDN caches your content

      Three chache modes:
        1. USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS
          - requires origin responses to set valid cache directives and valid caching headers
        
        2. CACHE_ALL_STATIC
          - auto caches static content that doesn't have no-store,private or no cache directive
        
        3. FORCE_CACHE_ALL
          - unconditionally caches responses, overriding any cache directives set by the origin

      Note:
        - not to cache:
          - private data
          - per user content such as dynamic HTML or API responses
