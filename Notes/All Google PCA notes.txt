Week 2 Introducing Google Cloud

Learning objectives
	1. Identify the benefits of Google Cloud.
	2. Define the components of the Google network infrastructure, including points of presence, data centers, regions, and zones.
	3. Identify the difference between infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).

Cloud Computing Overview
	- way of using IT that has 5 equal important traits
		1. On demand and self service
		2. Access those resources from anywhere over the internet
		3. Provider allocates resources to users out of the pool
		4. Resources are elastic means flexible
		5. Pay what you use/reserver as they go

Why in demand nowadays?
	History
		First wave
			colocation
				- users rents physical space of the DC provider without investing own data center
		
		Second wave
			virtualized data center
				- uses virtual devices, match physical building blocks(CPUs, Disks, network) of hosted computing resources
				- enterprieses still maintain infra and user controleed/user-config env
				- not fast enough cuz not automated

		Third wave
			Container-based architecture
				- fully automated elastic(auto scale) means automated service and scalable data
				- auto provision and config infra used to run app

		Future wave
			Data Company
				- great software based on high quality data

	- policies defined in
		org node
		folder
		project
Four level hierarchy
	1. resources
		VM in GCE
		buckets in GCS
		tables in bigquery

	2. Projects
		org in folders or subfolders
		policy here can enbale and use 
			services, 
			api, 
			billing, 
			add/remove collaborator
		can have diff owners and users
			billed and managed serpately

		attributes
			project id
				globally unique and can't be changed
				immutable
					used by google of exact project to work with
			proj name
				user created
				can be changed anythime
			proj number
				unique proj number 
				used by google to keep track resources

	3. Folders

			- getting highest uptimes for interconnection
		
	4. Partner Interconnect
		- provides connectivity between onprimes and VPC network through supported ISP
		When to use
			- on premise DC can't connect to colocation DC
			- dat dont neet an entire 10 GB per second conenction
			- support critical services or app that can tolerate downtime
		
	5. Cross Cloud Interconnect
		- establish high BW dedicated connectivity bet google cloud and another cloud service provider
		- available in 10GbpS or 100Gbps

		- Cloud interconnect/AWS Direct connect
			- a private hallway comm between onpremise or google cloud
				- on premise  and google cloud connects through colocation facility using BGP bet Cloud router and onpremise router

		2. Explore VPC Networking. 
		3. Implement Private Google Access and Cloud NAT

	VPC 
		- an isolated/private network where you can define IP address range to be used for your resources

	Projects, Networks and Subnetworks

		Projects
			- associates objects and services with billing
			- 15 networks

		Networks
			- can be shared with outher projects or be peered with VPC peering

			CIDR(classless inter-domain routing)
				- ways of splitting network to a smaller network called subnet
				- method for allocating IP addr

		Types
			Default
				- every project
				- one subnet per region
				- default firewall rules

				Auto Mode
					- Default network
					- one subnet per region
					- regional IP allocation
					- fixed /20 subnet per region
					- expandable upto /16

			Custom Mode
				- no default subnets created
				- full control of IP ranges
				- Regional IP allocation
				- Expandable to IP ranges

			Subnetworks
				- smaller network from splitted network
				- works on regional level
				- cross zone is possible
					- single FW rule can be applied to both VMs
				- 4 reserves IP addrs compares to AW which has 5
					- first
						- network addr
					- second
						- subnet's gateway
					- last
						- broadcast addr
					- ip before last
						- - broadcast addr

				-subnet mask
					- allows part of undelying IP to get add next values from next base IP

					Rules
						- cannot overlap with other subnets
						- ip range must be unique valid CIDR block
						- new subnet IP ranges have to all within valid IP ranges
						- can expand but not shrink
						- auto mode can be expanded from /20 to /16

			Notes
				- Same VMs located in same network can communicate using private addr
				- Two VMs in different network can comm with their private addr if using Google Edge routers/VPN
					- diff bill and security risks

			Expand Subnet
				- change sider notation to lesser number

				/29
					4 instances

				/24
					256-4= 252 instances

				/23
					508 instances

	IP Addresses
		Internal IP 
			- allocated from subnet range to VMs by DHCP
		
		DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) 
			- allows hosts to automatically learn various netwokr w/o manual static config 
			- automatically learn address of DNS server 
			- DHCP lease is renewed every 24 hrs 
			- VM name + IP is registered with network-scoped DNS 
			
		IPV4 ranges
			10.0.0.0/8
			10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
			172.16.0.0/12
			172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
			192.168.0.0/16
			192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

			External IP
				- assigned from pool(ephemeral/temporary)
				- reserved(static)
				- bring your own IP address(BYOIP)
				- VM doesn't know external IP
					- It is mapped to the internal IP

			Quotas/limits of instance per network
				- 15,000 VM

	Maopping IP addresses
		External IPs are mapped to internal IP

		Two types of internal DNS
			- Zonal(preferred)
			- Global

		Note
			- DNS name always poins to specific instance no matterr what internal IP addr is.

		Cloud DNS
			- google's DNS service
			- 100& uptome SLA
			- create and update millions of DNS records

		Alias IP range
			When to use
				- multiple service running on a VM and want assigh diff IP addr to each service

	Routes and Firewall Rules
		Cloud Routes \
		- defines the paths that network traffic takes from a virtual machine (VM) instance to other destination(same VPC network or outside).

		GCP Firewall Rules/Security group
			- stateful that allow/deny connections to or from your VM instances
			- Ipmlied deny all ingress and allow all egress by default
			- applited tot he network as a whole

			Use case(Egress)
				- Going out
				- VM to internet
				- VM to VM

				Conditions
					- Desination CIDR ranges
					- Protocols
					- Ports

				Action:
					Allow
						- permit the matching egress connection

					Deny
						- block the matching egress connection

			Use case(Egress)
				- Going in
				- internet to VM
				- VM to VM

				Conditions
					- Source CIDR ranges
					- Protocols
					- Ports

				Action:
					Allow
						- permit the matching egress connection

					Deny
						- block the matching egress connection

	Pricing
		Network Pricing
			No charge 
				- Ingress 
				- egress to same zone(internal IP) 
				- egress to google products like maps/drive/youtube 
				- egress to dif cloud service within same region 
				- Staic and ephemeral external IP addr atttached to forwarding rules used by Cloud NAT/VPN tunnel

			Charge
				- egress to same zome(External IP per GB)
				- egress bet regions within US and CANADA(per GB)
				- egress between zones in the same region(per GB)
				- static external IP addr assigned but unused
				- static and ephemeral external IP addr used on standard VM instances
				- static and ephemeral IP add in use on preemptible VM instance

			Note
				Use Google CLoud Pricing Calculator

		Which instances should you be able to ping from mynet-us-vm using internal IP addresses?
			- mynet-eu-vm
				- same VPC network called mynet eventhough seprate zones,regions and continents can communicate

		Review
			- VPC networks are by default isolated private networking domains. 
			Therefore, no internal IP address communication is allowed between networks, 
			unless you set up mechanisms such as VPC peering or VPN.

Common Network Designs
	1. Availability and Disaster Recovery
		- Increased availibility with multiple zones
			- Two Vm instances in one network, subnet and region but different zone
		
		- Globalization with multiple regions
			- Two VM in same network, diff subnet, region and zone

	2. Security
		- Cloud NAT provides internet access to private instances
			Scenario
				One region
					- 2 Instances in different subnet
					- only use Internal IP and no Exteranl IP to make it private
					- use cloud NAT for egress access internet such as update/patching/config management server
						Cloud NAT	
							- managed network address translation service
							- does not allow ingress traffic
							- Keep VPC isolated and secured
		
		- Private Google Access to Google APIs and services
			- uses VPC Routing to allow communication between VM in different region in the same network
			- enable private Google access to allow VM instance  to reach external IP addr of Google APIs and services
				- Private VM instance need access to GCS bucket
				- Private Google Access
					- subnet level
					- only internal IP and no effect on external IP

	Qwiklabs - Implement Private Google Access and Cloud NAT
	https://googlecoursera.qwiklabs.com/focuses/34735427?parent=lti_session
	
	Objectives
		In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
			1. Configure a VM instance that does not have an external IP address
			2. Connect to a VM instance using an Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) tunnel
			3. Enable Private Google Access on a subnet
			4. Configure a Cloud NAT gateway
			5. Verify access to public IP addresses of Google APIs and services and other connections to the internet

		VM Instance creation
			- VM instance have ephemeral external IP bu default
				- can be cahnge in policy constraint at org/project level

		// SSH connectivity gcloud
			gcloud compute ssh vm-internal --zone us-east1-d --tunnel-through-iap

		Note:
			No external IP addr	
				- an only be reached by other instances on the network via a managed VPN gateway or via a Cloud IAP tunnel
			Cloud IAP 
				- enables context-aware access to VMs via SSH and RDP without bastion hosts

			Currently, which of your VM instances can access the image from your bucket?
				- Cloud Shell through SSH

			If Private Google Access is ON on subnet level
				- VM with only internal IP can only update for Google Ckloud packages or Google APIs and services

			Cloud NAT gateway	
				- implements outbound NAT, but not inbound NAT. 
				- in other words, hosts outside of your VPC network can only respond to connections initiated by your instances; 
				they cannot initiate their own, new connections to your instances via NAT.

			Cloud NAT logging
				- allows you to log NAT connections and errors. When Cloud NAT logging is enabled, one log entry can be generated for each of the following scenarios:
					- When a network connection using NAT is created.
					- When a packet is dropped because no port was available for NAT.
				
			For  Configure and view logs with Cloud NAT Logging pls refer to the qwiklab link above

	Quiz
	1. In Google Cloud, what is the minimum number of I addresses that a VM instance needs?
		- One: Only an internal IP address
	2. What are the three types of networks offered in Google Cloud?
		- Default network, auto network, and custom network.
	3. What is one benefit of applying firewall rules by tag rather than by address?
		- When a VM is created with a matching tag, the firewall rules apply irrespective of the IP address it is assigned.
			- ephemeral external IP addr is random that is why we use tag to make it simple and assigning match FW rules

					- gcloud CLi
		
	Images
		Public base images
			- Google
			- third party vendors
			- premium images(p)
			- Linux
			- windows

		Custom images
			- create new image from VM: pre-configured and installed SW
			- import from:
				- on-premium
				- workstation
				- another cloud
			- features	
				- image sharing/family/deprecation

		Machine Images
			- stores all:
					- config
					- metadata
					- permission
					- data from one or more disks
			- uses mainly in maintenance scenario such as instance cloning/replication/disk backups/recovery 

		Note:
			- Premium images(p) are charges per second after a 1 minute mon except SQL server images(charged after 10 min)

	Disk options
		Boot disk
			- VM comes w/ single root persistent disk from base image
				- avoid delete
					- disable delete boot disk when instance is deleted

		Persistent disks
			- network storage appearing as a block device
			- attached to VM through the network interface and not physically attached to the machine
			- can survice VM terminate
			- bootable means attach to VM and boot from it
			- spnapshots
			- scales with size
			- HDD or SSD options
			- disk rezising even running and attached
			- can be attached in read only mode
			- Zonal
				- reliable block storage
			- regional
				Usecase
				High availability/perfomance DB
					- active active across two zones
						- sync replication across zones
			- types
				1. pd-standard Disks
					- uses HDD
					- large data processing workloads uses sequential I/Os
					- large capacity only needed
				2. pd-SSD
					- perfomance SSD
					- enterprise app and high performance DB that req latency and more IOPS than pd-standard
				3. pd-balanced
						- uses SSD
						- max IOPS nad lower IOpS per GB
						- genearal purpose app bet pd-standard and pd-SSD
				4. pd-extreme
						- uses SSD
						- zonal only
						- highend DB workloads
						- high perforamnce for:
							- random access workloads an
							- bulk throughput
			Encrption keys
				- Google-managed
				- Cusotmer-managed
					- use CLoud key Management service
				- Customer-supplied
					- Customer-supplied encryption keys

		Local SSD
			- very high IOPS, lower latency, and higher througput than persistent disk
				- but ephemeral
			- physically attached to a VM
			- 375 GBdisk upto 24, totla of 9TB per instance
			- Data services reset but not VM stop or terminate	
			- w/o data redundancy
				
		RAM disk
			- tmfs
				- store data in memory 
			- faster than local disk but slower than memory	
				- use when app expects file sys structure and cannot directly store its data in memory
			- very volatile means erase on stop or restart
				- ephemeral
			- may need larger machine type if RAM was sized for the app
			- consider using persistent disk to back up RAM disk data

			Recommendation
				- use tmfs for fastest performance for small data structures
				- use for high memory VM along with persistent disk to back up RAM disk data

		Limitation
			Shared core machine type
				 - can only attach upto 16 disks
			standard/high memory/high CPU/memory-optimized/Compute-optimized
					- 128

		Note
			- Throughput is limited by number of compress
				- shares same BW w/ Disk IOPS
				- compete with any network egress/ingress throughput

			- Compute Hardware Disk
				- grow size
					- repartition
				- changes	
					- reformat
				- redundancy	
					- create redundant disk array
				- encryption
					- encrypt fiels before writing them to the disk
			
			- Cloud Persistent disks
				- simply grow disks and resize
					- virtual networked devices
				- redundancy
					- Snapshot
				- encryption
					- auto encrypted
				- Confidential
					- we can use own keys so no one can get data except us
				

			



	Common Compute Engine actions
		metadata	
			- useful for startup and shutdown scripts
				- use metadata server w/o additional authorization to get unique infor

		Moving instance within same region
			- automate the move by using gcloud command
				- gcloud comput instances move
			- update references to VM cuz it's not automatic
				- target VMs
				- target pools
			- process
				- shutdown
				- move to dest zone
				- restart

		Moving instance to diff region
			- process	
				- snapshot all persistent disk
					- custom image
				- create disk from that image in the new region
				- create new VM from that region
				- attach that snapshot
				- assign static external IP
				-  update references to new VM
				- delete previous VM/disks/snapshot
		
		Snapshot
			- stored in GCS
				- not visible in your buckets cuz manage by the snapshot service
			- spnapshots are incremental and automatically compress 
				- means next snapshot will only copy the changes after the first snapshot
			
			Usage	
				- backup critical data for availability and drive
				- improve disk performance such us from HDD to SSD
					- resizing disk to improve I/O performance 
			
			Note
				- not applicable to local SSD
				- can grow disks in size but can never shrink them
				- snapshot doesn't backup VM metadata, tags and et.

		Recommendation
			- store startip/shutdown scripts in GCS
