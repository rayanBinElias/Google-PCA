      Overview
      In this lab, you will build a continuous integration pipeline using Cloud Source Repositories, Cloud Build, build triggers, and Artifact Registry.

      Objectives
      In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

        1. Create a Git repository
        2. Create a simple Python application
        3. Test Your web application in Cloud Shell
        4. Define a Docker build
        5. Manage Docker images with Cloud Build and Artifact Registry
        6. Automate builds with triggers
        7. Test your build changes

      //clone the gcloud source repos clone devops-repoe empty repository from cloud source repository
        gcloud source repos clone devops-repo
      
      //create an Artifact Registry repository named devops-repo:
        gcloud artifacts repositories create devops-repo \
    --repository-format=docker \
    --location=us-west1

      //To configure Docker to authenticate to the Artifact Registry Docker repository, enter the following command:
        gcloud auth configure-docker us-west1-docker.pkg.dev

      //To use Cloud Build to create the image and store it in Artifact Registry, type the following command:
        gcloud builds submit --tag us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/devops-repo/devops-image:v0.1 .
