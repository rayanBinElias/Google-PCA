	1. Understand how to navigate the course
	2. Understand how to download course resources

Module 1 - Identity and Access Management(IAM)
	- Administer Identity and Access Management for resources

	Learning Objectives
		1. Describe the IAM resource hierarchy
		2. Explain the different types of IAM roles
		3. Recall the different types of IAM members
		4. Implement access control for resources using IAM

	Identity and Access Management
		- identiyfying who can do what on which resources
		who
			- IAM member
		what
			- roles
				- permissions
		resources
			- Google cloud service

	

	Organization
		- root node for google cloud hierarchy
		- when workspace domain/identity accoun creates project, their domain name will be the name of their organization
		Roles
			Workspace/Cloud Identity super admin
				- assign the organization admin role to some users
				- be the point of contact in case of recovery issues
				- control the lifecycle of the workspace or cloud identity accound and organization resource
			- organization admin
				- control over all cloud resources
				- useful for auditing
				- define IAM policies
				- determine structure of the resource hierarchy
				- delegate responsibility over critical components such as 
					- networking
					- billing
					- resource hierarchy through IAM roles
			- project creator
				- controls project creation
				- control over who can create projects
	Folders
		- where you can isolate department -> teams -> products  or shared Infrastructure
		- allow delegation of adnmin rights

	projects
		- enabled: 
			- services, 
			- api, 
			- billing, 
			- add/remove collaborator
	
	Resource Manager Roles
		Organization
			- admin
				- full control over all resources
			- view access to all resources

		Folders
			- admin
				- full control over folders
			- creator
				- browse hierarchy and create folders
			- viewer
				- view folders and projects below a resource
		projects
			creator
				- create new projects(automatic owner) and migrate new projects into organization
			deleter
				- delete projects

	IAM Best Practices

	Qwiklabs - Exploring IAM
		Objectives
			In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

				1. Use IAM to implement access control
				2. Restrict access to specific features or resources
				3 . Use the Service Account User role
	
	Quiz
	1. What abstraction is primarily used to administer user access in IAM ?
		-  Roles, an abstraction of job roles
			- IAN uses predefined roles for giving user access
			-	roles are define by more granukar permissios.
			- permissions are not applied to users directly, only through the roles that are assigned to them
	2. Which of the following is not a type of IAM role?
		- Advanced
		Type of IAM role:
			1. Basic
			2. Predefined
			3. Custom

	3. Which of the following is not a type of IAM member?
		- Organization Account 	
		Type of IAM member
			1. GooCloud Identity domain
			3. Service Account
			4. Google Workspace domain
			5. Google group
			 
	Review
		- IAM builds on top of the Google Cloud services
		- Wokspace Admin/Cloud Identity
			- where creation of admin of corporate identities
			- handled by a person seprate from Google CLoud Administrator
		- Google Groups
			- establish a roles to all members
		- Wokspace admin
			- administers membership in the group
		- Service Accounts
			- enable you to build IaaS through terraform

Module 2 - Storage and Database Services
	- Implement data storage services in Google Cloud

	Learning Objectives
		1. Differentiate between Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Firestore and Cloud Bigtable
		2. Choose a data storage service based on your requirements
		3. Implement data storage services

	Scope
		Infrastructure Track
			- Service differentiators
			- When to consider using each service
			- Set up and connect to a service
		
		Data Engineering Track
			- How to use a database system
			- Design, organization, structure, schema and use for an application
			- Details about how a service stores and retrieves structured data

	Quizes
	1. What data storage service might you select if you just needed to migrate a standard relational database running on a single machine in a datacenter to the cloud?
		- Cloud SQL
	2. Which Google Cloud data storage service offers ACID transactions and can scale globally?
		- Cloud Spanner
	3. Which data storage service provides data warehouse services for storing data but also offers an interactive SQL interface for querying the data?
		- BigQuery
			- data warehousing service that allows storage of huge data sets while making them immediately processable w/o having to extract or run the processing in a separate service

	Review
