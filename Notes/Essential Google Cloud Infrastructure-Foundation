Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation

Layman's Term of the following:
Cloud Infrastructure
	Imagine you're in a City.
		- The infrastructure is the basic facilities and sys such as
electricity, communications, water, fuel, sewerage systems.
		- The people are the end users 
		- The cars, bikes, motorcycle and buildings like a mall/restaurant are the applications

Container
	- portable box which contains an app

Kubernetes
	- ochestrate code in containers


Module 1: Interacting with Google Cloud

Learning Objectives
	1. List the different ways of interacting with Google Cloud
	2. Interact with the Google Cloud console and Cloud Shell
	3. Create Cloud Storage buckets
	4. Deploy solutions using Google Cloud Marketplace

Using Google Cloud
	Ways to Interact with Google Cloud
		1. Google Cloud console
			- Web user interface

		2. Cloud Shell and Google Cloud CLI/SDK/gcloud
			- CLI

			Cloud shell
				- Temporary Compute Engine VM
				- Command-line access to the instance via a browser
				- 5 GB of persistent disk storage ($HOME dir)
				- Pre-installed Cloud SDK and other tools
				- gcloud: for working with Compute Engine and many Google Cloud services
				- gcloud storage: for working with Cloud Storage
				- kubectl: for working with Google Kubernetes Engine and Kubernetes
				- bq: for working with BigQuery
				- Language support for Java, Go, Python, Node.js, PHP, and Ruby
				- Web preview functionality
				- Built-in authorization for access to resources and instances
		
		3. Rest-based API
			- For custom applications

			Restful API
				- get/post/put/delete
				- JSON 

			Two pupose why google cloud client Librariers exposes APIs
				App APIs
					- provide access to services

				Admin APIs
					- functionality for resource management
					- build auttomated tools

		4. Cloud Mobile App
			- For iOS and Android

			Features:
				- manage VM and DB instances
				- manage apps in app engine
				- manage your billing
				- Visualize projects w/ customizable dashboard

	Qwiklabs - Working with Google Cloud Console and Cloud Shell

		Objectives:
			- Get access to Google Cloud
			- Create a GCS using the google cloud console
			- Create a GCS bucket using cloud shell
			- Become familiar with Cloud shell features

		Create a GCS bucket using cloud shell
			//Create GCS bucket
				gcloud storage buckets create gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

			//upload my local file to GCS bucket
				gcloud storage cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

				//if file name has spaces
					gcloud storage cp â€˜my file.txt' gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

		Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell
			//list current config 
				gcloud config list

			//config set project
				gcloud config set project

			//list all available regions
				gcloud compute regions list

			config file
				REGION=asia-southeast1
				PROJ_ID=realve-study

			.profile
				source config

			To create a persistent state in Cloud Shell, which file would you configure?
				-.profile

	Qwiklabs - Infrastructure Preview

		Objectives
			- Use Marketplace to build a Jenkins Continuous Integration environment.
			- Verify that you can manage the service from the Jenkins UI.
			- Administer the service from the Virtual Machine host through SSH.

		Google Cloud Marketplace lets you quickly deploy functional software packages by providing pre-defined templates with which Google Cloud service?
			- Deployment Manager
				- acquiring a virtual machine instance and installing and configuring software for you.
				- Google Cloud service that uses templates written in a combination of YAML, python, and Jinja2 to automate the allocation of Google Cloud resources and perform setup tasks
				Behind the scenes created
					- VM 
						- startup script to install and config software
						- network FW rules to allow traffic to the sercvice

			Shut down and restart Jenkins service
				sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh stop
				sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart
Quiz
1. Which of the following does not allow you to interact with Google CLoud?
	- Cloud Explorer

2. What is the difference between the Google Cloud Console and Cloud Shell?
	- Cloud Shell is a command-line tool, while the Cloud Console is a graphical user interface


Module 2: Virtual Networks

Learning Objectives
	1. List the VPC objects in Google Cloud
	2. Explore VPC Networking.
	3. Implement Private Google Access and Cloud NAT

VPC
	- an isolated/private network where you can define IP address range to be used for your resources

Projects, Networks and Subnetworks

	Projects
		- associates objects and services with billing
		- 15 networks
	
	Networks
		CIDR(classless inter-domain routing)
		- ways of splitting network to a smaller network called subnet 
		- method for allocating IP addr

	Types
		Default
			- every project
			- one subnet per region
			- default firewall rules

			Auto Mode
				- Default network
				- one subnet per region
				- regional IP allocation
				- fixed /20 subnet per region
				- expandable upto /16

		Custom Mode
			- no default subnets created
			- full control of IP ranges
			- Regional IP allocation
			- Expandable to IP ranges
