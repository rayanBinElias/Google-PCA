Week 2 Introducing Google Cloud

Learning objectives
	1. Identify the benefits of Google Cloud.
	2. Define the components of the Google network infrastructure, including points of presence, data centers, regions, and zones.
	3. Identify the difference between infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).

Cloud Computing Overview
	- way of using IT that has 5 equal important traits
		1. On demand and self service
		2. Access those resources from anywhere over the internet
		3. Provider allocates resources to users out of the pool
		4. Resources are elastic means flexible
		5. Pay what you use/reserver as they go

Why in demand nowadays?
	History
		First wave
			colocation
				- users rents physical space of the DC provider without investing own data center
		
		Second wave
			virtualized data center
				- uses virtual devices, match physical building blocks(CPUs, Disks, network) of hosted computing resources
				- enterprieses still maintain infra and user controleed/user-config env
				- not fast enough cuz not automated

		Third wave
			Container-based architecture
				- fully automated elastic(auto scale) means automated service and scalable data
				- auto provision and config infra used to run app

		Future wave
			Data Company
				- great software based on high quality data


IaaS and PaaS
	IaaS
	 	- cloud manage:
	 		raw compute/server/virtualization
	 		storage
	 		newtork
	 	- you:
	 		app
	 		data
	 		runtime
	 		middleware
	 		OS

	 	Sample
	 		Compute Enigine

	PaaS
		- cloud manage:
	 		everything
	 	- you:
	 		app
	 		data
	 	Sample
	 		App engine

	 Serverless/Function as a service
	 	AWS/GCP run containers for you based on CPU/RAM you need
	 	you don't manage/provision servers so you can concentrate on code
	 	lambda/cloud function
	 		even-drivent driven code
	 			pay as you go
	 	cloud run/ECS-Fargate

	 SaaS
	 	- cloud manage all
	 	app run in the cloud as a service
	 	Sample
	 		gmail
	 		docs
	 		drive

The Google Cloud network
	Region(40)/AWS Region(33)
		singapore

	Zone(121)/Availability-zone(105)

				OS of image

		Premises security

	Service deployment layer
		Encryption of inter-service communication
			provides crypto privacya nd remote procedure call(RPC) data on network

			RPC
				used when one comp talks to other comp over internet
				protocol use to enable program to exec code of another computer
				remote control

	User Identity layer
		User Identity
			google central identity service utilizes U2F

	Storage services layer

		Reducing insider risk
			continuous limit employee access and montiors them
		Employee universal second factor(U2F) use
			U2F
				2 factor authentication like MFA
				prevents phishing attacks
		Software development practices
			practices
				central souce control
				two party cid review
				lib that prevent code class security bugs
				runs vulnerability rewards programs
					pay anyone who can discover nugs in the infra

Open source ecosystems

	Operations suits
		can monitor workloads across multiple cloud providers

Pricing and billing
	kb8s
		per seconnd billing

	Instance run more than 25% of a ,onth
		discount for every incremental min use fot that inca

		POnline pricing calculator

	Cloud Billing is AWS budget
		can create alert with budget limit met
		can be set with 50,90,100

	Cloud quotas
		 manage qoutas fir each cloud services
		 prevent sover consumption of resource

		Rate quotas
			project level

		Allocation qoutas
			project leve


Quiz
1. What is the primary benefit to a Google Cloud customer of using resources in several zones within a region?
	- For improved fault tolerance/availability

2.What type of cloud computing service lets you bind your application code to libraries that give access to the infrastructure your application needs?
	- PaaS(cloud run/build/app engine)

3.Why might a Google Cloud customer use resources in several regions around the world?
	- To bring their applications closer to users around the world, and for improved fault tolerance


Week 3 Resources and Access in the cloud

Learning Objectives
	1. Define the purpose of and use cases for IAM.
	2. List the methods of interaction with Google Cloud.
	3. Use Cloud Marketplace to interact with Google Cloud.
	4. Identify the purpose of projects on Google Cloud.

Google CLoud resource hierachy
	- directly relates to how policies are managed and applioed when you google cloud
	- policies are inherited downward
	- policies defined in
		org node
		folder
		project
Four level hierarchy
	1. resources
		VM in GCE
		buckets in GCS
		tables in bigquery

	2. Projects
		org in folders or subfolders
		policy here can enbale and use 
			services, 
			api, 
			billing, 
			add/rmeove collaborator
		can have diff owners and users
			billed and managed serpately

		attributes
			project id
				globally unique and can't be changed
				immutable
					used by google of exact project to work with
			proj name
				user created
				can be changed anythime
			proj number
				unique proj number 
				used by google to keep track resources

	3. Folders
		- allows can be used to group different department
		give team allow delgate admin rights for wokring independelty

	4. Org node that encompasses all three above

Cloud resource manager
	manage projets
	API that can gather list of all projects associateds with an an coount
	create new proj
	update exist project
	delete projects
	can recover deleted prokects
	- can be access through RPC and REST API

Project creator role
	conrol who can create projects means who can spend money

Workspace domain/org node
	projects will belong to this domain

Creating org node
	workspace domain
	cloud identity
	google identity
	acceess
	application
	endpoint mngmt platform

Identity and Access Management(IAM)
	power to restrict authorizations/access

	IAM policy
		set by admin
		a set of rules who can access resources
		
		who
			account
			group
			service account
			cloud identity domain
			- principal
				email add
		can do whaat
			role
				contains permissions
				
				Three kinds 
					1. basic
						affect all resources in the project

						proj viewer
							can accesss without edit
						prok owner
							can access and edit
							can manage broles and permission and set up billing
						proj editor
							can access and edit
						proj bill admin
							contorl billing of project and change resource in project
					2. predefined
						like instanceAdmin in GCE
					3. custom
						assign role that has specific permission
						can only be applied to project or org level
			why
				easier to mange

		principle
			zero trust security or least privilege permission


Service accounts
	-non human account withou human login that can access resources on behalf of syst/app

	Use case
		want only GCE VM to access cloud storage


Cloud Identity
	centrally managed users account like disabling them/removing from the group access to team's resources with google admin console

	- already abailbe to google workspace customer

	Active Director/LDAP(lightweight dir access protocol) sys
		a phone book that track who's who and their access bet computers and apps over a network


Interacting with Google Cloud
Four ways to access resources
	1. Google cloud console/web browser
	2. Cloud SDK and CLoud Shell
		Cloud SDK
			cli in local machine
			 like gcloud and bq/bigquery
			- can manage google cloud resources
		Cloud Shell
			ClI in cloud console
			5 gb home dir
			debian VM
			cloud sdk gcloud pre installed
	3. APis
		allow code to be written to conrol services
		GOogle APis explorer
			shows what APis available in a resources
	4. Google Cloud app
		provides up to date bill info and alerts if budget is met
		can setup costom graphs of cpu, network/request per sercond
